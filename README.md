Need to understand the roles of each positions fully and has a full grasp of what they will be responsible for.
We will also go through the tasks of each member at the beginning of our meeting to ensure that everyone has cooperated & completed their tasks.

7. Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members:

Keep communication open & fully consider a member's idea. If a team member hasn't been participating or cooperating, the team can reach out to that person & ask their ideas are.

8. Strategies for keeping on task:
- using Trello & checking in at each meeting to hold each team member accountable
- during meetings, we will use our team agenda to stay on top of tasks
- if there's any conflict with the team, creating a plan to minimize obstacles will allow the team to progress further.

D. Personal Accountability

1. Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings:

Every team member is expected to show up on time to every team meeting. However, if a team member is not able to join the meeting/ will be late to a meeting, that should be communicated prior to the team's meeting time.

2. Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:

Every team member is expected to turn in all team assignments and tasks for the project by their deadlines. However, if a team member is not able to turn in an assignment on time, that should be communicated to the team & Dr. Goadrich prior to the deadline.

3. Expected level of communication with other team members:

Besides our meetings twice a week, generally if a team member encounters a problem that requires extended help / advice from the team, that should be communicated to the team in a timely manner to avoid extra obstacles. Overall, the team should communicate with each other as necessary outside of our meeting times.

Everyone should agree with / be aware of team decisions and tasks. Everyone should be on the same page in regards to any decisions to avoid obstacles & conflict later on.
